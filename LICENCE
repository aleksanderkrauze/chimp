This project is dual-licenced under GPLv3-only and LGPLv3-only licences.

This means that it can be used in both free and proprietary projects.
If you use it in a proprietary project you need to say that you use this library
and point to a LGPL licence. This is all you have to do if you use an unmodified
version of this project. If you make modifications you must release them under
either LGPL or GPL licence.

Copies of both licences are distributed alongside source code of this library.
